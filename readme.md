## About IQ VMS

IQ-WEB The front-end allows a user to modify specific settings and watch recordings in a easy-to-use interface. The back-end is a solution that processes the camera feed with computer vision algorithms to detect motion, and makes recordings and/or execute specific actions. IQ-WEB supports any type of IP-camera (RTSP/ONVIF), USB (V4L2).

Depending on the flavor you choose, you will have to install different components, but the idea as described above remains the same.
